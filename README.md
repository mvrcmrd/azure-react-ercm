Mosaic is free software distributed under the GNU LGPL. 
Read LICENSE for more information about license.

The web page containts three sections:
	A header
	A body where the mosaic is built
	A footer with a button to redo the mosaic every time is clicked
The application has been developed in React js and based on Azure Static Web App resource 
linked with a Github repository. It is an example of continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) so, every time the Github repository is updated, automatically the
process of deployment in Azure Static Web App is launched and the new deployment is also
automatically accessible using the application's public url.


Usage:
	In order to access the application, launch your preferred web browser and access to the
	initial page. 
	In test environment: http://localhost:3000
	In production: https://mango-tree-009989910.azurestaticapps.net/
	A 12x12 mosaic of squares and circles (random) with random background color and a 
	random character between A and Z with a random color will appear.
	There is a Randomize! button in the footer. Everytime this button is clicked, the
	12x12 mosaic is updated with new shapes, colors and characters.
	Clicking in a shape will replace the character by an image. The rest of the mosaic
	remains unaltered. Clicking again in the shape with the image, will recover the
	original character and its color.
	The mosaic keeps its look and feel when the browser's window is resized
	(mosaic is not recalculated and it keeps proportions in squares, circles and characters)
